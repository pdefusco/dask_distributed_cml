    - use "!pip3 install -r requirements.txt" if in session prompt


2. Execute the notebooks in order
    - Quickly Creating Dask Clusters via CML methods (01)
    - Basic Dataframe Operations and Using Parquet Files (02)
    - Distributed Scikit-Learn via Dask (03)
    - Introduction to Dask-ML (04)
    - DaskÂ meta-estimators as alternative for using Scikit-Learn on Dask (05)
    - More realistic Dask-ML example (06)
